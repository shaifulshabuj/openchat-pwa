# Local Test: Initial Specification Validation

## Context
The OpenChat PWA application is deployed at: https://shaifulshabuj.github.io/openchat-pwa

This prompt initiates a comprehensive test of the deployed application against the original specification document to validate feature completeness and functionality.

## Objective
Test the deployed application against the initial specification and update project status documentation with findings and next steps.

## References
- Specification: `./work_reports/00_SPECIFICATION_OPENCHAT_PWA.md`
- Status Report: `./work_reports/01_PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- Deployed App: https://shaifulshabuj.github.io/openchat-pwa

## Tasks

### 1. Review Specification
- Read the complete specification from `./work_reports/00_SPECIFICATION_OPENCHAT_PWA.md`
- Identify all required features and functionality
- Note any specific technical requirements or constraints

### 2. Test Against Specification
- Access the deployed application at https://shaifulshabuj.github.io/openchat-pwa
- Test each feature listed in the specification:
  - User authentication (registration, login, logout)
  - Chat functionality (create, send, receive messages)
  - Real-time updates (WebSocket connectivity)
  - PWA features (offline support, installability)
  - UI/UX requirements
  - Performance requirements
  - Security features

### 3. Document Findings
- List all implemented features with status (working/not working/partially working)
- Identify missing features from specification
- Note any bugs or issues discovered
- Document any deviations from specification

### 4. Update Project Status
- Update `./work_reports/01_PROJECT_STATUS.md` with:
  - Latest test results
  - Current project status
  - Features completed vs. pending
  - Prioritized list of next tasks
  - Recommended next steps

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All specification features tested
- [ ] Findings documented clearly
- [ ] Project status report updated
- [ ] Next steps prioritized and documented
- [ ] Any critical issues flagged for immediate attention

## Output Format
Update `./work_reports/01_PROJECT_STATUS.md` with structured sections including test results, status summary, and next action items.
